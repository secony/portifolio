            <p>My name is Guilherme Secone Neves, I am 16 years old and a high school student focused on development
                and
                technology. Currently, I am continuously studying programming, seeking to improve both my technical
                skills
                and my logical reasoning and problem-solving abilities. I have a degree in Computer Science from
                Microlins,
                where I acquired a solid foundation in computing, and I am a student in the technology area at
                Alura, a
                platform where I am deepening my knowledge in programming and developing practical projects. I am
                interested
                in learning new technologies, creating functional solutions, and constantly evolving as a developer.
                This
                portfolio brings together some of my studies and projects, reflecting my dedication, curiosity, and
                desire
                to grow in the technology field.
